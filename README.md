# BOOK-Me is the ticket booking website.

- This website is designed for event planners to sell tickets for their events
  and make sure that people can easily book tickets and print them out at their homes or nearby internet cafe.
  The website is made easy to use for both sellers and buyers, the seller will be required to register to sell tickets,
  where the buyer will only be required to enter their Name and Email address for the ticket to be forwaded to.
  The website will be a free website, but a certain amount percentage will be deducted upon each ticket purchase.
